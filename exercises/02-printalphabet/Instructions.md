# Print Alphabet

This project is a simple Go program that prints the Latin alphabet in lowercase letters on a single line.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions

Write a program that prints the Latin alphabet in lowercase on a single line.  
A line is a sequence of characters followed by the **end of line** character `\n`.

### ðŸ’¡ Why this exercise matters
This exercise may look simple, but it teaches several key programming fundamentals:
- **Loops & Iteration** â†’ practice iterating from `'a'` to `'z'`.  
- **Runes & Unicode** â†’ understand that letters are just numeric values in Unicode.  
- **Output Functions** â†’ learn precise character printing using `PrintRune` or standard library functions.  
- **Discipline in Constraints** â†’ solving problems with limited allowed functions sharpens creativity.  
- **Foundation for Bigger Problems** â†’ the same principles will later apply to working with strings, input/output, and more complex algorithms.
