# Exercise: Write and Test Your First Go Program

Welcome to your first hands-on task in Go! You will write a simple program that prints a message to the screen, then confirm its correctness with automated testing.

## 📝 What You’ll Do

- Create a Go program that prints `hello, world` to the terminal.
- Explore the structure and meaning of every line of code.
- Write or review an automated test to ensure your output is correct.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand the basics of Go file/project structure.
- Know how to write, explain, and test a Go program.
- Get comfortable with running programs and basic tests from the terminal.

## 🧑‍💻 Tasks

1. **Edit `main.go`:**
   Write a Go program that prints `hello, world`.

2. **Run Your Code:**
   Open the terminal and execute: ```go run main.go```

3. **Explain the Code:**
    For deeper understanding, add comments or refer to `main_explained.go`. ```go run main.go```

4. **Test Your Code:**
    Use the built-in test provided in `main_test.go` to ensure your output matches expectations. ```go test```

5. **Read the Doc:**
Read `docs/explained.md` for in-depth explanations and best practices.

6. **Bonus Challenge:**
Modify your program to print a different message. Update the test to match and see if it catches the change!

## 🎓 Tips

- Don’t rush through the explanations; understanding *why* every line matters is key!
- Use comments in your code to remind yourself what each part does.
- Rerun tests every time you edit `main.go`.
